	      		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	      		<p>There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a Dately Account, we can make those services even better – to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.</p>
	      		
	      		<h2>Information we collect</h2>
	      		<p>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful or the people who matter most to you online.</p>
	      		<p><span>We collect information in the following ways:</span><br/>Information you give us. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Dately Account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address or telephone number. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we will also ask you to create a publicly visible Dately Profile, which may include your name and photo.
Information we get from your use of our services. We collect information about the services that you use and how you use them. This information includes:
</p>
	      		<p>Device information: We collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Dately may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Dately Account.</p>
	      		<p>Log information: When you use our services or view content provided by Dately, we automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This includes:
Details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.
</p> 
	      		
	      		<p>Telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls.
Internet protocol address.
</p> 
	      		<p>Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.
Cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Dately Account.
</p> 
	      		<p>Location information: When you use Dately services, we may collect and process information about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide Dately with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.</p> 	      		
	      		<p>Unique application numbers: Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Dately when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.
Local storage: We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.
</p>
	      		<p>Cookies and similar technologies: We and our partners use various technologies to collect and store information when you use a Dately service, and this may include using cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or device. We also use these technologies to collect and store information when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services.
Information we collect when you are signed in to Dately, in addition to information we obtain about you from partners, may be associated with your Dately Account. When information is associated with your Dately Account, we treat it as personal information.
</p> 

	      		<h2>How we use information we collect</h2>
	      		<p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Dately and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.</p>
	      		<p>We may use the name you provide for your Dately Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Dately Account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Dately Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Dately Profile information, such as your name and photo.</p>
	      		<p>If you have a Dately Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Dately or on third- party applications connected to your Dately Account (such as reviews you write and comments you post) in our services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your Dately Account.</p>
	      		<p>When you contact Dately, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.</p>
	      		<p>We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Dately Analytics. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer.</p>
	      		<p>Our automated systems analyze your content (including posts) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.</p>
	      		<p>We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Dately services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Dately’s services and the ads delivered by Dately.</p>
	      		<p>Dately processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.</p>
		      	
		      	<h2>Transparency and choice</h2>
	      		<p>People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can:
Review and control certain types of information tied to your Dately Account by using Dately settings.
</p>
	      		<p>Adjust how the Profile associated with your Dately Account appears to others.
Control who you share information with through your Dately Account.
You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
</p>
	      				      		
	      		<h2>Information you share</h2>
	      		<p>Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines, including Dately. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content.</p>
	      		
	      		<h2>Accessing and updating your personal information</h2>
	      		<p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes.
We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.
</p>
	      		
	      		<h2>Information we share</h2>
	      		<p>We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Dately unless one of the following circumstances applies:
We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Dately if we have a good- faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
</p>
	      		<p>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Dately, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.
</p> 
	      		<p>We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.
If Dately is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale.
</p> 
	      		
	      		<h2>Information security</h2>
	      		<p>We work hard to protect Dately and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. In particular:
We encrypt many of our services using SSL during transit.
We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
We restrict access to personal information to Dately employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations.
</p>
	      		
	      		<h2>When this Privacy Policy applies</h2> 
	      		<p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by.
Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you in search results, sites that may include Dately services, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.
</p> 

	      		<h2>Changes</h2> 
	      		<p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We may modify our Privacy Policy from time to time or any additional terms that apply to our Services, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at our Privacy Policy regularly.</p>
